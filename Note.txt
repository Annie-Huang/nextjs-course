http://localhost:3000/news
http://localhost:3000/new-meetup


TutorialPart1:
##########################
For http://localhost:3000/something-important, you can have two ways:
- pages/news/something-important.js
- pages/news/something-important/index.js

<a href='/news/nextis-is-a-great-framework'>NextJS Is A Great Framework</a> VS
<Link href='/news/nextis-is-a-great-framework'>NextJS Is A Great Framework<Link>
If you just use <a href='/news/nextjs-is-a-great-framework'>NextJS Is A Great Framework</a>
 Then when you click the link and then refresh the page, it will come back to news\index.js
 It means you don't have a single page app here. It means that we're always sending a new request
 to the backend to fetch a new html page whenever the user navigates around


TutorialPart2:
##############################
For this structure:
- pages/new-meetup/index.js
- pages/[meetupId]/index.js
When i do http://localhost:3000/new-meetup/, how does it know to go to the first one but not the second one???
It will. Must be some smart way underneath this does this.


UseRouter:
<button onClick={showDetailsHandler}>Show Details</button>
const router = useRouter();
const showDetailsHandler = () => {
router.push('/' + props.id);
};


When you just got this:
  const [loadedMeetups, setLoadedMeetups] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    // send a http request and fetch data
    setLoadedMeetups(DUMMY_MEETUPS);
  }, []);
  return <MeetupList meetups={loadedMeetups} />;
If you open devtool, you can see the list is empty because the list will only be fetch in the second cycle when the data is fetched from backend.
Next got a solution for this using page pre-rendering. The two forms of pre-rendering are:
- Static Generation
- Server-side Rendering


Static Generation:
===============================================================
Need to Build for production, meaning run 'npm run build'
This is not as bad as it sounds, as the home page content usually doesn't change. And if it changes, you just need to 'npm run build' it again.

!!! This is the best explanation i have so far for the need for getStaticProps() function and how its logic will help.

// If it got the getStaticProps, it will call this to create the props first. Then calling your components and pass the props to your component,
// hence resolve the problem of when the component is loaded, the data is not fully fetched yet and SEO is not optimized problem.
//
// And if you add 'async' to your getStaticProps, The app will force to wait for data as well.
// This code is executed during the build, not when your app is alive in prod.
// When you open devtool after using getStateProps, you will see the ul>li got the details of the meetup info
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // fetch data from API
  return {
    props: {
      meetups: DUMMY_MEETUPS,
    },
  };
}

λ  (Server)  server-side renders at runtime (uses getInitialProps or getServerSideProps)
○  (Static)  automatically rendered as static HTML (uses no initial props)
●  (SSG)     automatically generated as static HTML + JSON (uses getStaticProps)
   (ISR)     incremental static regeneration (uses revalidate in getStaticProps)


Incremental static regeneration (IRS):
==============================================================
// The Page will occasionally be re-pre-generated on the server after deployment so that you don't have to redeploy and rebuilt all
// time just because some data changes.
// revalidate: 10 means retrieve again if it's more than 10 seconds from the previous request.
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // fetch data from API
  return {
    props: {
      meetups: DUMMY_MEETUPS,
    },
    revalidate: 10,
  };
}

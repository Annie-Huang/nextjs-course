C:\react>npx create-next-app nextjs-course

http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/news

For http://localhost:3000/something-important, you can have two ways:
- pages/news/something-important.js
- pages/news/something-important/index.js


<a href='/news/nextis-is-a-great-framework'>NextJS Is A Great Framework</a> VS
<Link href='/news/nextis-is-a-great-framework'>NextJS Is A Great Framework<Link>
If you just use <a href='/news/nextjs-is-a-great-framework'>NextJS Is A Great Framework</a>
 Then when you click the link and then refresh the page, it will come back to news\index.js
 It means you don't have a single page app here. It means that we're always sending a new request
 to the backend to fetch a new html page whenever the user navigates around
